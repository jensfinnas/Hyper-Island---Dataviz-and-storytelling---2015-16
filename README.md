# DDS: Data visualization and storytelling

## The assignment

In short: analyze a set of data, find a story, present it.

#### What data?

Each group will get a client, a brief and a set of data to work with. You are welcome to combine the client data with other data sources.

Use the expertise of client to understand the topic and the data. Where should you start looking for a story?

#### What should the final product look like?

The final product should be some sort of __digital presentation published online__. It can be an interactive application, a static infographic or a video.

The product should stand on its own. A stranger should be able to look at it and understand what it is about when they see it for the first time.

#### Mid-term and final presentations

We will do mid-term presentations on January 25th. Each group gets 3 minutes to present what they are doing and 10 minutes for discussion.

At this point you should have a clear idea about what story you want to tell. Use this presentation to get feedback on your work so far and how to proceed.

The final presentations will be on February 4th. The day before at 23:59 you should submit your work for online evaluation.

Be prepared to answer questions such as these:

- What do you want to say?
- What is the purpose?
- Who is the audience?
- Why did you choose this form?

#### How will you be evaulated?

You will be peer reviewed by your classmates and get feedback from Jens and Thomas. Our evaluation will revolve around these questions:


- How interesting is your story? And does the data support it?
- Does the user get the message? 
- Is the presentation aesthetic and well designed?

Creativity is, as always, appreciated.
